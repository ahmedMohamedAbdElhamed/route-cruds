Product Management System with CRUDS

Description
Welcome to the Product Management System with CRUDS project! Developed during my journey at Route Academy, this system is designed to streamline your product management tasks with ease. CRUDS stands for Create, Retrieve, Update, Delete, and Search, encompassing the five essential operations that empower this powerful project.

Key Features:
Add new products with prices and descriptions effortlessly.
Update or delete products as needed to keep your inventory up-to-date.
Display products in an organized table for quick reference.
Utilize the efficient search function to find products by name or category with highlighted matches.

Technologies Used:
The system is built using HTML, CSS, Bootstrap, and the powerful capabilities of Vanilla JavaScript. Local storage ensures your product data remains secure and retrievable at any time. Additionally, a Color Mode feature lets you toggle between night and light modes, enhancing your user experience.
